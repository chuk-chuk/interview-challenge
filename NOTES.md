To improve:

Test coverage isn't great, due to limited time the tests are not completed, but I have added a few test scenarios to demonstrate the the knowledge of testing and I wish I could more examples to include post/get/delete of other endpoints

When you add and item to the preview section you need to refresh the page in order to see the cards (needs more work)

Remove functionality not fully working, but I guess my approach demonstrates the direction how I decided to persist the data (using additional endpoints to add and remove items from the selected list)

I chose to use the context api to slice the state into two parts: all items and selected for preview items.
